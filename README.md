## Hi, I'm Olly.

I'm Olly! I'm currently working as a SWE @ Collective Benefits striving to help the lives of people through the way I best know how; delivering quality, stable and beautiful software.

Founded [ts-rest](https://ts-rest.com) to help deliver type safe APIs to teams across the world, helping them focus on what matters most.

### My Principles
- Keep it simple
- Collaboration over being a individual contributor
- Tailor your project to your **needs** not your **desires**
- Actively seek out and destroy obstacles to productivity 
- Avoid preemptive optimisations
- In person (or video) chats > messaging 

### Spicy Takes 🌶️
- Monoliths are underrated
- Servers are great
- Scrum is for estimation, not targets
- Teams of engineers not programmers

### My Preferences 
`techs.filter(tech => ['Typescript', 'Rust'].includes(tech))`
