## Hi, I'm Olly.

I'm Olly! I'm currently working as a Senior Eng @ Onsi - striving to help the lives of people though the way I best know how; delivering quality, stable and beautiful software.

Founded [ts-rest](https://ts-rest.com) to help deliver type safe APIs to teams across the world, helping them focus on what matters most.

### My Principles
- Keep it simple stupid
- Collaboration over being a individual contributor
- Avoid preemptive optimisations
- In person (or video) chats > messaging

### Spicy Takes
- Web dev became too complicated (HTMX ðŸ«¶)
- Monoliths are underrated, servers are great
- Trunk based development/Extreme practises aren't that extreme
- Teams of engineers not programmers

### My Preferences 
Typescript if I'm feeling boring ðŸ¥±, Go if I'm starting something fresh âœ¨, or Rust if I'm feeling spicy and have too much free time.
